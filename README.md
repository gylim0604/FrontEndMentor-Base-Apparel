### What I learned

This was one of those I need to do something, let me go to FrontEnd Mentor and find something projects. Honestly there wasn't anything to tricky about it. 

The only slightly interesting part was that there was a specific background used for the content. The size was not enough to cover the full screen, but I figured if I made the background the same size as my content excluding the image, it would work perfectly, and well it did :) .
